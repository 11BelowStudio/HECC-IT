## Welcome to HECC-IT!

This is a toolkit that you can use to produce hypertext games.

You can convert .hecc files into playable hypertext games with HECC-UP.
And you can get some help making and editing your .hecc files using OH-HECC.

So let's cut to the chase.


## The technical documentation for CE301

Please go to [./Technical Documentation/README.md](./Technical%20Documentation/README.md) for the
table of contents for the technical documentation.

If you want to see the information about every single class/method/etc all individually
documented, please go to the [./JavaDocs](./JavaDocs.zip) folder for the full JavaDoc-style
documentation. You will to download and unzip that folder on your computer to actually
browse through them though.

If you wanted a brief overview of the classes in each package, please refer to the
package-level READMEs in each subfolder of [./src](./src).

If you wanted to know about how to use HECC-IT, please consult the [HECC-SPECC](./Documentation%20for%20HECC-IT/HECC-SPECC.md)
document for more information.

And if you wanted to download HECC-IT so you can use it yourself, please download and unzip
the [HECC-IT downloadable version](./HECC-IT%20downloadable%20version.zip).

## What the HECC does this do?

* You can use OH-HECC to make and edit your hypertext game in .hecc format.
    * You can also just write your .hecc file with any text editor if you'd prefer to do that.
    * Consult the 'HECC-SPECC' document if you need to see a reference for the HECC language.
        * HECC Super Precise Explanation for Creating Code
* You can use HECC-UP to convert your .hecc code into a playable HECCIN Game
    * Select your .hecc file
    * Select a folder to output your game to
    * If your .hecc file contains valid .hecc code
        * It will output the HECCIN' Game defined by the .hecc file into that folder
    * If your .hecc file does not contain valid .hecc code
        * Your game will not be exported, and it will tell you what to fix.
* You can then play your HECCIN Game
    * Open 'index.html' in the output folder you selected to play it.
        * Make sure you don't delete `heccer.js`, `hecced.js`, or `showdown.min.js`
