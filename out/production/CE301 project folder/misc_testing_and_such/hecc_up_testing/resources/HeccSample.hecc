this line is before the first passage declaration, so, officially, this line doesn't exist!

::Start

starting passage content goes here.
The following line contains a link to "Another passage".
[[Another passage]]

::Another passage [yes] <34,35>

congrats you clicked that link to get here, Another passage.
why not [[click this|Yet Another Passage]] as well?

::Yet Another Passage

woah you clicked that so you're now at Yet Another Passage.

Do you want to go [[Left]], [[Right]], [[Back to the start|Start]], or [[Skip this nonsense|dave]]?

::Left

You go to the left, but the path leads you back to [[dave]].

::Right

You went to the right, but the path leads you back to [[dave]].

::dave

This passage is called dave.
dave's content doesn't include any links to any other passages.
So I guess this counts as the end.
