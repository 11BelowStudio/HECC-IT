            tbh imma probably attempt to get this div to stay where it is, even if the div holding passage content changessize, to make it easier to go back.
            might just make it go above/to the side of the passage content div or something idk
            but I guess it's still perfecly functional where it is, y'know?

                If you're reading this, that means there's been a big oopsie with the passage loading lol.<br/>
                It might be because you're on internet explorer.<br/>
                Or you've disabled JavaScript.<br/>
                Or perhaps your browser doesn't support JavaScript 6/JavaScript 2015<br/>
                Alternatively, it might mean that someone forgot to unzip the folder this game came in,
                or that someone's misplaced the scripts that are needed for the game to run.</br>
                But yeah something's very clearly gone very wrong.</p>

    //constructs a 'Heccer' object, called 'TheHeccer', starting from the named starting passage (as defined in HECCED.js)

    window.onload = getHECCED;
    //when the window loads, it will call the getHECCED() method defined in HECCED.js (setting up theHeccer and making it start working)
