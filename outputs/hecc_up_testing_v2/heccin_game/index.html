            might just make it go above/to the side of the passage content div or something idk
            but I guess it's still perfecly functional where it is, y'know?

            <p>if you're reading this, that means that there's been a big oopsie with the passage loading lol.<br/>Or it means you're on internet explorer.<br/>Or you've disabled JavaScript.<br/>But yeah something's very clearly gone very wrong.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "backDiv">
            <p><a id="backButton" onclick="theHeccer.goBack()">this text is the back button</a></p>
            <!-- tbh I might opt to make the entire div into the back button or something in the future, instead of just the back button text -->
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>bottom text.</p>

<p>yes I know it looks terrible. but prototyping just do be like that, y'know? they don't think it be like that, but it do!</p>

<p>tbh this text underneath the game will probably be gone in the proper HECCER MVP thing. And the overall layout will hopefully be less Badâ„¢. No promises about the writing quality though.</p>

<p>but yeah enjoy the hypertext vidyagaem!</p>

    //constructs a 'Heccer' object, called 'TheHeccer', starting from the named starting passage (as defined in HECCED.js)

    window.onload = getHECCED;
    //when the window loads, it will call the getHECCED() method defined in HECCED.js (setting up theHeccer and making it start working)
