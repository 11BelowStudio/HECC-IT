## afternoon, a story (Michael Joyce, 1987)

* Written in Storyspace [1]
    * Probably a bit more complex than whatever I can make with HECC (due to the nature of Storyspace being pretty darn complex)
    * Can't play it myself
        * Costs $24.95, distributed as a USB stick, and only runs on Macintosh.
        * There is an online version (https://wwnorton.com/college/english/pmaf/hypertext/aft/), but, as it uses Java Applets, it doesn't work on modern browsers.
* What I can work out about it from watching someone else play it [2]
    * Certain words are the links, clicking on them redirects to the other 'pages' of the book
    * Not obvious what is/isn't a link
        * It appears that you need to click a certain button on the interface to highlight what words are the links
    * Purely text-based
* There allegedly is a chapter about this book in 'Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature', however, I have not been able to access a legit copy of the book with access to that chapter.
* Synopsis
    * 'the story of Peter... who (in reading) begins his afternoon with a terrible suspicion that the wrecked car he saw hours earlier might have belonged to his former wife'
        * not sure if I can get any meaningful information from that

## Lexia to perplexia (Talan Memmott, 2000)

* Apparently about 'the relationship between human consciousness and network phenomenology'
* It's *technically* playable online [3]
    * However, it uses certain functionality which is no longer supported by modern browsers, rendering it unplayable
        * so yeah I can't play it
    * Supposed to click on images and also text in order to navigate through the game
        * layout is very odd, things positioned in weird places in different pages
        * interface inconsistent between pages
* Can't find any videos of it being played

## of Day, of Night (Megan Heyward, 2004)

* Written in Macromedia Director (renamed to Adobe Director, since discontinued)
* Can't play it myself
    * $35.00 for it in CD-ROM format, and I don't have a CD-ROM drive, so I can't actually play it.
* Synopsis [4]
    * About a woman called Sophie who 'has lost the ability to dream', and 'attempts to spark her unconscious into dreaming again'
* Can see video of it being played [5]
    * Multimedia (video, audio, text, and spoken word)
        * Much more complex than anything HECC-IT will be capable of
    * 'Day' segment
        * Link text only visible when your cursor is near it
        * Clicking a link sends you to another screen containing audiovisual content
            * moving your cursor around this screen reveals other bits of text to supplement the audio/video stuff on there
            * some of these segments require you to click other links/interact with objects within it in order to be finished with the link
        * After done with the link, more content is added to the main screen
            * More links (still only visible when your cursor is near them), which perform the usual link stuff
            * More ambient music plays in the background
            * Some of the new links also play some ambient music whilst your cursor is near them
        * Final link is the 'arrange' link
            * You need to 'arrange' some labels in a cabinet, each label representing the objects found during some parts of the 'day' segment
    * 'Night' segment
        * More links, but this time representing dreaming
        * The available links depends on how you arranged the objects in the 'arrange' segment
            * The links are essentially 'dreams', emerging from the combinations of the objects found in the 'day' segment
            * Example
                * 'Car' and 'Notebook' labels put close to each other: dream where Sophie gets into her car, looks at her notebook, and drives off is available
    * Has a 'help' section, with some guidance for what to do

* much more complex than anything I'll be able to pull off

## The Glass Snail (Milorad Pavić, 2003)

* Actually is playable on modern computers [6]
    * First choice is for the introductory chapter
        * The two introductory chapters present the same scene from two perspectives
            * The architect, David Senenmut
                * Establishes that he recently divorced his wife, but has an agreement with his ex-wife that he can still enter her apartment, if he doesn't take anything out of it.
                * He steals a box from his wife's apartment (turns out that it was his christmas present)
                * Notices Miss Hatshephut's store, decides to attempt stealing a nightdress from there, under the guise of getting something for his wife
                * Steals a nightdress, doesn't realize that he's been given a lighter, accidentally leaves the box behind
                * Eventually realizes that he forgot the box, and that he now has a mysterious lighter in his pockets
            * The lingerie store salesgirl, Miss Hatshepsut
                * Establishes that she has a habit of pickpocketing people, and giving the things she pickpocketed to other people via reverse-pickpocketing
                * Stole a lighter, bearing the inscription '*If you strike me three times, your wish will be granted*', from someone on her way to work
                * Slipped the lighter into Senenmut's pocket whilst he visited her store, and took the box which he left behind at the store
                * Box contains the titular glass snail
        * After finishing the introductory chapter you chose, you are sent to the chapter you didn't choose.
        * This is then followed by a third chapter (set on the next day)
            * Mr. Senemut goes back to Miss Hatshephut's store, admits to the theft, asks about the box.
            * Doesn't get the box, but is invited by Miss Hatshephut to spend the evening with her 
    * Second choice determines how it will end
        * Player is warned that 'The Christmas Candle' leads to a tragic ending, and that 'The Lighter' leads to a happy ending
        * 'The Christmas Candle'
            * Miss Hatshepsut empties the snail, fills it with bath powder, and makes it usable as a decorative candle.
            * Mr. Senenmut arrives, Miss Hatshephut gives him the box with the glass snail in it as a christmas present
            * Mr. Senenmut gives Miss Hatshephut the lighter as a christmas present
            * Miss Hatshephut reveals that she knows Mr. Senenmut's name
            * Miss Hatshephut suggests that Mr. Senenmut should light the candle whilst she sorts out dinner, tells him to light the lighter 3 times as per the inscription
            * When the lighter was lit for the third time, it explodes, killing Mr. Senenmut and Miss Hatshepsut, and destroying the apartment.
        * 'The Lighter'
            * Mr. Senenmut visits his ex-wife's apartment, takes a bottle of wine, and puts it (with the lighter) in a gift bag.
            * He visits Miss Hatshephut, bringing the gift bag for her.
            * Events play out like in 'The Christmas Candle'
            * However, the lighter doesn't do anything on the third time
            * Revealed that the lighter was filled with dynamite, and was set up to explode on the third strike. Implied that Mr. Senenmut read this, and defused it/intentionally didn't light it the third time.
