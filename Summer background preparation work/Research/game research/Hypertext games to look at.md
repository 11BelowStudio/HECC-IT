## afternoon, a story (Michael Joyce, 1987)

* Written in Storyspace [1]
    * Probably a bit more complex than whatever I can make with HECC (due to the nature of Storyspace being pretty darn complex)
    * Can't play it myself
        * Costs $24.95, distributed as a USB stick, and only runs on Macintosh.
        * There is an online version (https://wwnorton.com/college/english/pmaf/hypertext/aft/), but, as it uses Java Applets, it doesn't work on modern browsers.
* What I can work out about it from watching someone else play it [2]
    * Certain words are the links, clicking on them redirects to the other 'pages' of the book
    * Not obvious what is/isn't a link
        * It appears that you need to click a certain button on the interface to highlight what words are the links
    * Purely text-based
* There allegedly is a chapter about this book in 'Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature', however, I have not been able to access a legit copy of the book with access to that chapter.
* Synopsis
    * 'the story of Peter... who (in reading) begins his afternoon with a terrible suspicion that the wrecked car he saw hours earlier might have belonged to his former wife'
        * not sure if I can get any meaningful information from that

## Lexia to perplexia (Talan Memmott, 2000)

* Apparently about 'the relationship between human consciousness and network phenomenology'
* It's *technically* playable online [3]
    * However, it uses certain functionality which is no longer supported by modern browsers, rendering it unplayable
        * so yeah I can't play it
    * Supposed to click on images and also text in order to navigate through the game
        * layout is very odd, things positioned in weird places in different pages
        * interface inconsistent between pages
* Can't find any videos of it being played

## of Day, of Night (Megan Heyward, 2004)

* Written in Macromedia Director (renamed to Adobe Director, since discontinued)
* Can't play it myself
    * $35.00 for it in CD-ROM format, and I don't have a CD-ROM drive, so I can't actually play it.
* Synopsis [4]
    * About a woman called Sophie who 'has lost the ability to dream', and 'attempts to spark her unconscious into dreaming again'
* Can see video of it being played [5]
    * Multimedia (video, audio, text, and spoken word)
        * Much more complex than anything HECC-IT will be capable of
    * 'Day' segment
        * Link text only visible when your cursor is near it
        * Clicking a link sends you to another screen containing audiovisual content
            * moving your cursor around this screen reveals other bits of text to supplement the audio/video stuff on there
            * some of these segments require you to click other links/interact with objects within it in order to be finished with the link
        * After done with the link, more content is added to the main screen
            * More links (still only visible when your cursor is near them), which perform the usual link stuff
            * More ambient music plays in the background
            * Some of the new links also play some ambient music whilst your cursor is near them
        * Final link is the 'arrange' link
            * You need to 'arrange' some labels in a cabinet, each label representing the objects found during some parts of the 'day' segment
    * 'Night' segment
        * More links, but this time representing dreaming
        * The available links depends on how you arranged the objects in the 'arrange' segment
            * The links are essentially 'dreams', emerging from the combinations of the objects found in the 'day' segment
            * Example
                * 'Car' and 'Notebook' labels put close to each other: dream where Sophie gets into her car, looks at her notebook, and drives off is available
    * Has a 'help' section, with some guidance for what to do

* much more complex than anything I'll be able to pull off

## The Glass Snail (Milorad Pavić, 2003)

* Actually is playable on modern computers [6]
    * First choice is for the introductory chapter
        * The two introductory chapters present the same scene from two perspectives
            * The architect, David Senenmut
                * Establishes that he recently divorced his wife, but has an agreement with his ex-wife that he can still enter her apartment, if he doesn't take anything out of it.
                * He steals a box from his wife's apartment (turns out that it was his christmas present)
                * Notices Miss Hatshephut's store, decides to attempt stealing a nightdress from there, under the guise of getting something for his wife
                * Steals a nightdress, doesn't realize that he's been given a lighter, accidentally leaves the box behind
                * Eventually realizes that he forgot the box, and that he now has a mysterious lighter in his pockets
            * The lingerie store salesgirl, Miss Hatshepsut
                * Establishes that she has a habit of pickpocketing people, and giving the things she pickpocketed to other people via reverse-pickpocketing
                * Stole a lighter, bearing the inscription '*If you strike me three times, your wish will be granted*', from someone on her way to work
                * Slipped the lighter into Senenmut's pocket whilst he visited her store, and took the box which he left behind at the store
                * Box contains the titular glass snail
        * After finishing the introductory chapter you chose, you are sent to the chapter you didn't choose.
    * This is then followed by a third chapter (set on the next day)
        * Mr. Senemut goes back to Miss Hatshephut's store, admits to the theft, asks about the box.
        * Doesn't get the box, but is invited by Miss Hatshephut to spend the evening with her 
    * Second choice determines how it will end
        * Player is warned that 'The Christmas Candle' leads to a tragic ending, and that 'The Lighter' leads to a happy ending
        * 'The Christmas Candle'
            * Miss Hatshepsut empties the snail, fills it with bath powder, and makes it usable as a decorative candle.
            * Mr. Senenmut arrives, Miss Hatshephut gives him the box with the glass snail in it as a christmas present
            * Mr. Senenmut gives Miss Hatshephut the lighter as a christmas present
            * Miss Hatshephut reveals that she knows Mr. Senenmut's name
            * Miss Hatshephut suggests that Mr. Senenmut should light the candle whilst she sorts out dinner, tells him to light the lighter 3 times as per the inscription
            * When the lighter was lit for the third time, it explodes, killing Mr. Senenmut and Miss Hatshepsut, and destroying the apartment.
        * 'The Lighter'
            * Mr. Senenmut visits his ex-wife's apartment, takes a bottle of wine, and puts it (with the lighter) in a gift bag.
            * He visits Miss Hatshephut, bringing the gift bag for her.
            * Events play out like in 'The Christmas Candle', however:
                * Mr. Senenmut reveals that he knows Miss Hatshephut's name
                * The lighter doesn't do anything on the third time
                * It's revealed that the lighter was secretly a weapon filled with dynamite, and was set up to explode on the third strike. However, neither of the characters were aware.
                    * Implied that it didn't explode because the characters wished for a life together or something, following the inscription on it, causing the lighter to not explode.
        * After reading through one ending, the reader is invited to read the other ending
            * The definitive 'the end' screen is only reached after reading through the second ending
* Design and such
    * Reader has control over the plot, but little influence over the story
        * How the reader controls the plot
            * Is free to go forward/backward through the pages as they see fit
            * The introductory chapter choice allows readers to have different perspectives on the story in the introduction
                * They may view the events through the eyes of Miss Hatshephut or Mr. Senenmut
                * Only looking at the perspective of the other character once the reader is done looking at the perspective of the first character
                * Temporal shift back to the start of the scene before getting the other's perspective
            * The middle chapter (after viewing the first chapter from both perspectives) starts by looking at Mr. Senenmut, but ultimately focuses on both characters, from no particular perspective.
            * The final chapters also differ in perspective at the start
                * 'The Christmas Candle' starts from the perspective of Miss Hatshephut
                * 'The Lighter' starts from the perspective of Mr. Senenmut
            * Both endings also contain some information about the lighter that is only really relevant for the other ending
                * 'The Christmas Candle' contains Mr. Senenmut reading the inscription on the lighter (stating that it apparently grants a wish)
                    * but the lighter explodes in this ending, instead of granting a wish.
                * 'The Lighter' only has that inscription being read out from memory by Miss Hatshephut. Instead, the reader is informed that the lighter's instructions state that it's a weapon which is supposed to explode on the third strike.
                    * but the lighter grants a wish in this ending, instead of exploding.
                * Without the information from the other ending, this wouldn't make sense.
        * How the reader controls the story
            * Can only change the story (as in the events that happen) via their choice of final chapter
                * They either choose the 'tragic' ending, or the one that 'ends happily'
                * The events of both endings are still mostly constant, it's mainly the events at the very end of the story which are altered.
    * Aesthetics
        * Some degree of ancient egyptian-style 'gloss' for the interface/decorating the page
            * Probably due to the slight overtones of ancient egyptian myths present in the story (characters named after ancient egyptian figures, after all)
    * Overall story structure is still linear
        * The reader basically only chooses the order in which they read the component parts of the story.
        * They still get to read the whole thing
            * Choice that the player gets is arguably completely meaningless.

## Queers in Love at the End of the World (Anna Anthropy, 2013)

* Written in Twine/twee, uses the 'Sugarcane 1.2' story format
* Design
    * Overview
        * 10 seconds long
            * Game ends after 10 seconds
        * Basically about interacting with your partner before the end of the world
        * The time limit adds a sense of urgency to it, as, if you hesitate, you'll run out of time faster
            * Can't use a 'semantization' approach
                * literally impossible to travel down all the branching paths within the short time you have with your partner
                * lends itself more to a blend of self-reflection and absorption
                    * self-reflection because you're choosing how to interact with your partner
                    * absorption because you're under pressure from the time
                        * results in an honestly more immersive (and somewhat intense) experience
        * Only has text and the timer
    * Puts you into the situation and just leaves a lasting impression
        * Not quite sure how to put the feelings the game produces into words
            * bittersweet, I guess
    * It's the sort of experience you simply wouldn't get from normal, printed literature.

## the uncle who works for nintendo (Michael Lutz, 2014)

* Made in Twine 1.4.2/Twee, using the Sugarcane story format
* Design
    * Overview
        * About going to a friend's house for a sleepover, their titular 'uncle who works for nintendo' is visiting that night
            * Turns out that the aforementioned uncle is some form of eldritch abomination
    * Suits itself to self-reflection and semantization approaches
        * self-reflection because the game involves interacting with your 'friend'
        * semantization because there are 6 endings to the game, giving it replay value.
    * How it uses the format
        * Audio/pictures accompanying the text for the passages
        * The Uncle essentially materializes in the text itself, in the form of the error messages generated by the Sugarcane format upon attempting to parse invalid code
        * Keeps a record of what endings you have/have not discovered
            * Final ending only unlocks after getting the other 5 endings
        * Making certain choices (such as looking at the photographs on the wall, asking your friend about their uncle, going downstairs) open up other options
            * leading to other endings becoming (un)available

## Depression Quest (Zoe Quinn, Patrick Lindsey, Isaac Shankler. 2013)

* Written in Twine, uses SugarCane 1.2

* Design
    * Overview
        * It's a game about living with depression.
            * It keeps track of things such as your character's level of depression, whether or not you're on medication, and whether or not you're seeing a therapist
            * Certain choices are crossed out (and unusable) depending on how depressed your character is
                * Reflects how certain tasks feel somewhat impossible when living with depression
            * As someone who still is struggling with depression, I guess it does capture how it feels.
        * A 'self-reflective' reading style is needed
            * The player must choose how they want to deal with the situation, interacting with friends, co-workers, and family.
                * The player also gets to experience how depression can affect them, even if the player isn't depressed.
            * 'semantization' and 'exploration' aren't really catered for, seeing as your choices are limited by the overarching depression that your character is feeling.
            * The lack of choices could incite a somewhat 'absorptive' state for the player
                * Feeling somewhat helpless, absorbed into the overarching helplessness that their character experiences.
        * How it uses the format
            * Has some variables (basically keeping track of the state your character is in), uses those to limit/unlock choices
            * Has some additional pictures and such, mainly for decoration instead of for an active story reason
                * however, they do all give off a rather distant vibe
            * There's supposed to be audio as well, however, I think there's a problem with the website that hosts the game, preventing the audio from working.
* Overall, it's a rather deep reflection about how depression affects people
    * I think that I could attempt something along these lines for my game (albeit covering a slightly different topic)
