* Definition
    * *In ergodic literature, nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text.
    If ergodic literature is to make sense as a concept, there must also be nonergodic literature,
    where the effort to traverse the text is trivial,
    with no extranoematic responsibilities placed on the reader except
    (for example) eye movement and the periodic or arbitrary turning of pages.* [1]

* In english
    * Ergodic Literature: Reader needs to actively put effort in to read the text.
    * Non-ergodic Literature: Reader just needs to, y'know, read it.
        * No faffing around with choices and such, just going from start to finish.
    * Hypertext games: player must actively select a path to follow through the game: non-trivial effort
        * And that's before factoring in guard conditions, timers, variables, etc
