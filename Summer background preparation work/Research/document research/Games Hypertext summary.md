# Games/Hypertext

* Abstract
    * Relationship between literary hypertexts and narrative games
    
* **tl;dr**
    * 'Literary hypertexts appear to be a sub-type of narrative games', but 'narrative games are fundamentally hypertextual'
    * It's worth 'linking the worlds of hypertext and game design... apply known hypertext theory to new and modern contexts, and build a better theoretical understanding of electronic literature and games'
    
* What does this mean for my project?
    * Not much tbh
    * Apply some of the theory behind narrative games to my hypertext game?
