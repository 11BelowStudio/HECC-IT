# The important bits

* There's a 'lack of a shared understanding of "narrative", as well as related terms' in context of 'the relationship between games and narrative'
    * Paper attempts to 'acknowledge and visualize these differences, with the aim of improving the academic and professional discourse around games and narrative'
* Prior papers on the topic of videogames all give 'a variety of different meanings' to narrative.
    * Appears to be a 'narratology versus ludology debate'

* What the paper does
    * Used some 'mapping' to work out what other scholars consider 'narrative' to be
        * Attempting to find what the common definitions are
    * Scales used
        * 'Media Specificity' (0-6)
            * Extent to which the digital medium can affect narrative
                * 0: 'not affected', 'same entity' as a physical book or a film
                * 6: 'considerably affected', 'different entity' to a book or a film.
        * 'User Agency' (0-6)
            * Extent to which the user can impact narrative
                * 0: 'no impact', 'user equals viewer/reader'
                * 6: 'considerable impact', things such as 'decision making, sequencing, selection, co-creation'
                
* End result from the paper
    * Two clusters on the mapping of the understanding of narrative
        * High media specificity, high user agency
        * Low media specificity, high user agency
    * There appears to be consensus that the user does have a lot of agency over the narrative in games
        * Source of the debate actually appears to be whether or not the digital medium impacts the narrative
    * Scope to extend the mapping in the future
    
* What this means for my project
    * It points out that the notion of ergodic literature (as coined by E. Aarseth, in 'Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature), specifically 'the non-trivial effort required by the audience', 'translates to a high ranking on the user agency dimension'
        * However, as 'textual representations on paper can also qualify', that 'results in a lower score' for Media Specificity.
    * However, I'm not sure if that really translates into anything useful in context of my project.
    * Narrative of games definitely is affected by player agency(?)
