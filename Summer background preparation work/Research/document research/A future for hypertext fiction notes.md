* Intro
    * 'Why We Should Continue to Discuss Hypertext Fiction with Enthusiasm'
        * 'low sales, and more significantly, the near invisibility of hypertext to the vast majority of readers'
        * 'hypertext fiction appears to be of interest largely only to 'experts'... 'ordinary' readers appear scarce.'
            * However, there are examples of hypertexts that aren't overtly highbrow, and relatively accessible.
    * 'Cause for Optimism'
        * Problems encountered
            * 'unsatisfying hyper-linking'
            * 'seemingly random plot structures'
            * 'apparent lack of closure'
            * 'success or failure of the interface to facilitate navigation and deliver the story'
        * Can be overcome
            * 'excellent writing'
            * 'intriguing structuring via linking'
            * 'effective interface design'
    * 'The Need for Empirical Study'
        * 'the reactions of 'ordinary' readers... to hypertext fiction are significantly under-represented'
        * 'hypertext is allowing a mushrooming of narrative styles, structures, and delivery platforms (interfaces) that would confound the keenest reader'
            * 'systematic investigation of reader response *is* the only way to get at some of the deeper issues'
                
* Potential + problems
    * 'The Digital Book'
        * 'conflict in hypertext fiction - which writers and designers need to acknowledge and deal with - between familiarity and newness.'
            * Readers have 'a preconception of 'book'', before they 'shifted into whichever alternative paradigm they were motst familiar with'
        * 'dilemma and a challenge for writers'
            * 'the 'book'; must be acknowledged, because readers expecting to 'read' a piece of fiction will look for familiar signposts'
            * 'they soon shift their behaviour, because to continue to think 'book' is quickly confusing and frustrating'
                * 'must play close attention to the interface, because it is clearly a major influence upon readers' responses to the digital book and hypertext fiction'
    * 'The Interface'
        * 'aspect that receives little attention in the literature around hypertext fiction'
        * very important that it makes sense
            * 'should not challenge traditional document design values if it is to be accepted by readers'
            * 'there is no modern web or multimedia software platform that does not allow all the fundamentals of navigation and orientation to be included'
    * 'Disorientation'
        * Readers 'very quickly lose orientation, both in the story and in the 'book'/site, and even though they are quite happy to explore a hypertext, they all still want to know where they are'
        * Disorientation comes from
            * 'too much linking potential'
            * 'poorly structured linking'
            * 'poorly designed interfaces'
        * 'all readers need to "make sense" of a text to some extent'
            * 'narrative disorientation could seriously threaten or even destroy the reading experience altogether'
        * avoiding this problem
            * 'author must be firmly in control of the experience of traversing a hypertext'
                * 'reader expects each new segment of text to add purposefully to what has already been read'
                * 'author required for hypertext must be very aware that with reader choice comes (the potential for) great confusion'
            * interface
                * 'signposting that a book gives to a reader needs to be replicated and/or refashioned for a scene'
                    * 'disorientation only occurs when a writer wants it to occur'
                * An 'always on-screen narrative timeline' can help a reader to remain oriented
                    * Ensures a reader 'always knows where he is, where he has already been, and what is left'
    * 'Closure'
        * 'audiences expect narratives to run along 'orderly' lines... towards the ending that provides catharsis and satisfaction'
            * 'the ending and the closure it brings that makes sense of all that has gone before'
        * 'some hypertext advocates argue that closure may not be *the* point of narrative reading'
            * 'alternative pleasure... of exploring the weave of thoughts and associations created by the author's hyper/textual network'
            * 'at best challenging to readers used to the clear end-points of books and films, and at worst simply a turn-off'
        * Response from readers
            * 'could not find what they considered to be an ending, or they gave up before they found it'
                * 'the most emphatic expressions of displeasure came from those who craved but could not find the ending'
            * 'authors need to consider this'
                * 'If the author makes it apparent... closure of the conventional sort will be possible'
                * 'Closure of the kind Douglas describes will still be available if the hyperlinking system allows freedom of movement through the piece'
                    * But, the participants reaction was 'without some *author-designed* endplace, the whole narrative feels as if it is unfinished'
        * Conclusion on this point
            * 'no inherent law of hypertext that says that endings must be impossible to find, or non-existent'
            * 'hypertext fiction can have distinct endplaces and provide a more conventional kind of closure'
                * 'if writers choose to provide it'
    * immersion and flow
        * Writers face problems if they 'want to follow neither predictable narrative structures not familiar interface designs, leaving the reader with no ready schemas to draw upon'
            * 'may have to hold back, drip feed the challenges at a rate readers can cope with'
        * 'key to unlock states of immersion and/or engagement may well lie in the concept of flow'
            * 'if we accept the interface as an integral part of hypertext fiction's nature, flow should be acknowledged as a desirable state for readers'
        * 'if writers of hypertext fiction can balance their innovative narrative structures and interfaces with sufficient references to conventions (schema) familiar to readers, then flow may begin to be a readily achievable state'


* Empirical Study
    * This section covers researching the responses of readers to hypertext fiction (etc), however, as I doubt that I'll be able to perform such studies myself, I'll skim over this bit
    * Literary studies (looking at the response of the readers to the literature)
    * Interactivity and Usability studies (looking at how readers use/interact with the interface)
        * 'reader of hypertext fiction is also a 'user'... insofar as he/she has to operate the interface before the narrative can come to life... The interface cannot be ignored'
    * Study methods used
        * 'Think-Aloud'
            * Looking at how readers react to/attempt to interact with/thought processes regarding the interface
        * 'Free-reading'
            * Asking readers to 'read at will over a specified period, in an environment of the reader's choosing'
                * 'allows readers to truly interact with the hypertext in their own way'
        * 'Questionnaires'
            * 'used to aid the readers to reflect upon their reading experience at a point close to the actual reading'
        * 'Discussion (Focus) Groups'
            * Used as a ''wrapping up' of the previous three phases'
                * Focused on 'those readers with a keen interest and appreciation of print fiction'
                    * Divided further into 'those readers who are experienced PC and internet users... and those who are 'novice' PC users'
                * Presented 'a 'continuum' of hypertext styles... to readers so that some sense of the comparative effects of the text/interface/multimedia balance could be gained'

* Conclusions (future)
    * The study was 'ongoing' at the time of publication
    * 'Reader expectations and the Digital Book'
        * Reader expectations 'will not be met in full by hypertext fiction'
        * Reader frustration is guaranteed unless 'writers must accept they must conform, in some aspect of the story structure or interface design, to familiar conventions'
            * keep things understandable
    * 'The Interface'
        * 'interface is a crucial and central element in the likely success or otherwise of interactive narratives'
        * 'writers need to 'help' readers to travel the 'book' space and the narrative, by offering interface tools that can guide and position the reader in his or her journey'
            * Desired interface elements
                * ''Page' marking devices'
                * 'navigation tools must allow  as much control as possible... particularly being able to go to any page at will'
                * 'navigation tools must not be obscure... or hidden'
                * 'visual material must be part of the story being told, not simply decoration'
    * 'Disorientation'
        * Readers liked it when 'it is clear what the 'conventional' order would be, and it is clear where the story resolves into an ending'
        * Readers didn't like it when 'essential orientation devices were omitted or ineffective... the plot had seemingly been replaced by abstraction'
            * Readers especially criticized some games 'for not developing an intellegible or dramatically involving story'
            * Main issue was when 'linking... takes the reader to places not thematically or dramatically connected to where they were before'
        * Keep things understandable to the reader
            * don't do anything completely illogical/confounding, readers don't like that
    * 'Immersion and Flow'
        * Keep interface simple and ensure linking makes sense
            * 'the interface was easy for the readers to learn, but the links disrupted the narrative so much that not one of that reading group found the story'
            * 'the interface prevented half the group from finding large sections of the narrative'
            * 'the interface's oddities, combined with poor narrative sequencing via hyperlinks, almost completely destroyed reading pleasure'
        *  Readers prefer it when the game can 'deliver a narrative thread that the reader can find without the effort-reward ratio being skewed towards effort'
            * Make it easy to read, don't do too much weird stuff
        * 'Immersion is more likely and flow possible when the story develops in balance with interactivity'
    * 'Hyper-Links'
        * Participants 'were easily frustrated when linking seemed baffling, pointless, or just random'
        * Ideally, 'the link always takes the reader to a place that has a meaningful connection to the jumping-off point'
            * Keep the game coherent
    * 'Closure'
        * 'all but one of my participants wanted their sense of completion to be designed by the author'
            * include an explicit ending in my game to make it appealing

* What this means for my project
    * Game interface needs to make sense, follow general design conventions
        * Don't overcomplicate things/confuse the reader/etc.
    * Some navigation tools (allowing users to browse through the 'pages' at will) is somewhat desirable
        * Make them easy to see/use
    * Links should make sense
        * avoid linking to something that doesn't make sense in context of where it was linked from
    * Don't overload the player with unnecessary information
        * Only present the information that's relevant for the story at hand
    * Stick to common conventions of a story
        * Explicit beginning, middle, ending
