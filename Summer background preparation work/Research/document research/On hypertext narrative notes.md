* Abstract
    * 'hypertext will most frequently prove useful in changing (or adapting) *plot*.'
    * Article also looks at 'the use of stretchtext as a reaction against the perceived incoherence of classic hypertext narrative'
        * StretchText is a system of letting the reader determine what level of detail they want to read something at, ultimately not widely adopted: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StretchText

* The bits on hypertext narrative
    * 'hypertext provides choices or *links* which the reader may use to move through the text'
        * 'By choosing some links and not others, the reader may experience the text in different sequences'
    * Key words
        * *story*
            * 'the sequence of events that the narrative describes'
        * *text*
            * 'events are recounted to us in a (hyper) *text*'
                * 'The text may be written, but it need not be'
        * *links*
            * 'choices... which the reader may use to move through the text'
            * 'in some hypertexts, we click on images, or on any word, or we type words or commands'
        * *reading*
            * 'A specific trajectory through a hypertext'
        * *plot*
            * 'The sequence in which events are presented in a specific reading'
        * *presentation*
            * 'What we see on the page or the screen'
                * 'Changes to the presentation of a hypertext need not change the story or the plot... change our choice of typeface and size'
            * Interface between player and the game

* Hypertext and consequences
    * 'not only must a hypertext offer links, but the selection of links must be significant and consequential'
        * Choices must actually be, y'know, choices
    * 'Understanding the hypertext requires understanding the links it offers, both the consequences of following and the consequences of turning away'
        * Can't understand hypertext fiction without understanding the choices and the outcomes of them
    * 'If our choice of links is to prove more than superficially consequential, links must either affect the *story* or the *plot*'

* Changing the story
    * 'Malleability of story presents a number of difficulties'
        * In certain contexts (historian work, technical writing), 'variation of the story is undesirable'
    * Techniques already exist for changing the story (producing 'an inconsistent story')
        * 'unreliable narrator'
        * 'unclear division between reality and imagination'
        * 'breakdown of reality and perception'
        * These techniques question 'our everyday notions of time, reality, and order in much the same way as Cubism in painting and Dada in theater'
    * 'In electronic literature, hypertextual variation of story has not proved fruitless'
        * Types of works which this produces
            * '*game*'
                * 'reader is invited to identify with a character and led to desire a specific story, such as survival or a happy ending'
            * '*puzzle*'
                * 'reader finds it difficult to advance the narrative from its current state - as when she is caught in a maze of twisty passages, all alike'
    * 'few of the better-known hypertext narratives actually possess malleable stories'
    * perfluence and coherence
        * perfluence is 'the immersive state of mental visualization that is the hallmark of one kind of naturalistic fiction'
        * 'concern over coherence in hypertext is often accompanied by a desire to recapture perfluence'
    * 'using links to vary the *story* appears less promising than using links to vary the *plot*'

* Changing the plot
    * Why change the plot instead of changing the story
        * 'changing the story... is futile; the world is full of unhappy sons, precocious daughters, officious rulers, and wayward taxis'
            * 'only interesting because of the specific particularity'
        * 'Links may vary the *plot*... in many significant and useful ways'
            * 'the *story*... may remain unchanged; what changes is how, when, and whether these events are described'
    * Methods of manipulating the plot (whilst story remains unchanged)
        * 'switch among different points of view, providing multiple perspectives on the same unfolding actions'
        * 'may shift in time, letting us interpolate into a scene its antecedents of its consequences'
        * 'may shift in place, permitting us to view simultaneous events that occur in different places'
        * 'may permit the writer to vary pacing, providing more or less detail'
    * Uses for this outside of fiction
        * Could be useful in context of history.
            * 'it is impossible to narrate everything that can be known, and that no single narrative strand or sequence will meet all needs or satisfy all audiences.'
                * 'Changes in plot, without changes in underlying story, exert powerful effects on our understanding of the material'
                * Allows the whole event to be viewed/understood from multiple perspectives/scales/viewpoints etc, allowing multiple arguments to be accounted for.
                
* Plot And The Cycle
    * 'Hypertext structure is perceived through *recurrence*'
        * 'The cycle, not the branch, goto, or jump, is the central hypertext structure.'
    * 'Cycles were once thought to be defects... This view was wrong: we cannot dispense with cycles'
    * Acyclic hypertexts
        * can only be appreciated as hypertexts 'only by returning to the start and reading it again'
            * Inherent cycle going back to the start from the very end
        * 'need to approach the task of writing an acyclic hypertext with great care, lest combinatoric explosion exhaust our creativity and patience'
            * 'cannot hope to offer even the illusion of free will'
    * If a story has multiple plots which provide different meanings, 'a hypertext can contrive to tell both' (or all the plots)

* Work in hypertext
    * 'We want hypertext narrative to be valued'
        * 'this has meant that it either must compel respect because it is frequently demanding ("ergodic"...) or that it must be wildly profitable'
            * 'steps not from any property of hypertext, but from the constitution of the military-entertainment complex and its academic counterparts'
        * 'should not mistake the choices made by individual writers for the inclinations, much less the constraints, imposed by the medium'



* Most of the rest of the article looks at a StretchText system, which is somewhat out of the scope of the project.
    * However, the ability to allow things to be expanded to show additional content might be worth implementing

* Propositions made throughout the article
    * '**Proposition 1: Hypertextuality is perceived through re-reading and reflection**'
        * Can't tell if something truly is hypertext or not unless the links actually have different results
    * '**Proposition 2: the four fundamental links in narrative are recursus, timeshift, renewal, and annotation**'
        * Recursus
            * 'we follow once again the cycle, either literally... or in a new variation'
        * Timeshift
            * 'we revisit the scene... because now it means something new and that knowledge is crucial to understanding what happens next'
        * Renewal
            * 'we proceed... to a new node that, for from following naturally... takes off in a direction that no one could have anticipated'
        * Annotation
            * 'expanded exposition, definition, anecdote, intertextuality, lyric, and footnote'
    * '**Proposition 3: conventional stretchtext greatly restricts plot navigation**'

* Conclusion
    * 'If a hypertext narrative is to attempt what we cannot achieve in print, link choices must have consequences'
        * Choices need to be important
    * 'Links may vary story, plot, or presentation, but the most interesting and useful realm... is frequently plot'
        * Changing the plot ('The sequence in which events are presented in a specific reading') has more potential than changing other things.
        * 'We percieve this variation... through recurrence'
            * 'A recurrence will be followed by one of the four fundamental classes of link: recursus, timeshift, renewal, or annotation'
    * 'Hypertext narrative is not inherently incoherent'
        * 'ergodic nature may result as much from the circumstances of its production'
    * 'hypertext reading environments can now be done using standard Web components'
    
* What this means for my project
    * Game
        * Ensure that the choices the player is presented throughout the game actually are, y'know, relevant choices
        * Attempt using links to alter the plot, not just the story
            * Might be useful if I produce something that presents a certain series of events, and allows the player to 'view' them however they want to 'view' them (or something idk)
        * Remember the inherently cyclic nature of hypertexts
            * Make sure that there are other paths to be viewed by players who wish to go through another cycle of the hypertext
            * Paths can merge, but don't make all the choices from a node effectively have the same result
