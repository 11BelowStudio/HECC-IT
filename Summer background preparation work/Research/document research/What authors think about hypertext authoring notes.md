        * 'Publishing'
    * 'For challenges we identified 18 codes under 5 themes, falling into 3 phases of development'
        * 'Pre-production'
            * 'User/Tool Misalignment'
            * 'Documentation'

            * 'Programming Environment'
        * 'Post-production'
            * 'Longer-term issues related to the narrative's Lifecycle'
    * 'the authoring problem... is rooted in the common misalignment between'
        * 'the authors' expectations and the tools capabilities'
        * 'the fundamental tension between expressivity and complexity'
        * 'invisibility of the edges of the process to researchers and tool builders'
    * 'a less monolithic view of authoring would allow designers to create more focused tools and address issues specifically at the places in which they occur'

* Authoring steps
    * Ideation
        * 'the stage of creative thinking'
        * 'the birth of ideas'
        * 'the coming together of story components to build the narrative foundation of a story'
    * Training/Support
        * 'guiding the author on how to use the authoring tool via examples, guides, or tutorials'
    * Planning
        * 'Sketching out the plot(s) of a story, creating characters, drafting events, and making notes'
    * Visualising/Structuring
        * 'Graphically creating, studying, and revising the structure of a story'
            * '(meaning the relationships between events, characters, chapters or scenes)'
            * 'granting an overview of the whole'
    * Writing
        * 'Inputting content that is part of the narrative presented directly to the reader (typically the text)'
            * Not 'any specialised language of the tool'
    * Editing
        * 'Revising, augmenting, and changing the content and structure of the story'
            * 'embedding media in the text, changing stylesheets, keeping a revision record, or updating the structures or relationships between nodes'
    * Compiling/Testing
        * 'Checking that the design is complete and error free'
            * 'without any loose ends or empty nodes'
        * 'in the case of a tool with its own vocabulary'
            * 'syntactical errors or any other coding faults'
    * Publishing
        * 'exporting a story format and making it available'
        * 'distributing it through a venue where readers will be able to access and read it'

* The problems
    * Pre-production
        * User/tool misalignment
            * 'Conceptual misalignment'
                * 'misalignment between what the authors wanted to achieve, and what the tool could actually do'
                    * Need to make it clear what the tool can and can't do
            * 'Expertise misalignment'
                * 'in some cases users were clearly attempting to do things that the tool was not designed for'
                    * Need to make it clear what the tool was not designed for
            * 'Ontological misalignment'
                * 'vocabulary and structures in the tool did not match the mental model of the user'
                    * Need to ensure the vocab/structures make sense
            * 'Workflow misalignment'
                * 'tool required the author to work in an order that they were uncomfortable with'
                    * Should allow the author to have some flexibility in their work order
        * Documentation
            * 'The known unknowns'
                * 'authors knew what they wanted to do, were aware that the tool could do it, but could not figure out how to make it happen'
                    *        
            * 'The unknown unknowns'
                * 'they did not know, and found it hard to discover, whether the tool had a particular capability or not'
                    *
    * Production
        * Complexity
            * 'Content tracking'
                * 'internal consistency of the text'
                    * 
            * 'Variable tracking'
            * 'Scalability'
            * 'Versioning'
        * Programming Environment
            * 'Lack of programmable environment'
            * 'Separation of content and behaviour'
            * 'Lack of debugging tools (testing)'
    * Post-production
        * Lifecycle
            * 'Profitability'
            * 'Platform support'
            * 'Maintenance'
