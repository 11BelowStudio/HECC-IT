* concepts for context
    * 'Hypertext' (defined by T. H. Nelson)
        * 'non-sequential writing', branches+choices, many pathways between linked text chunks
    * 'Death of the Author' (defined by R. G. Barthes)
        * basically argued that writing and the creator are unrelated

* examples of ergodic literature
    * *Composition No. 1, Roman*, M Saporta (1962)
        * Box with 149 loose pieces of paper (+1 fixed start page in the front cover)
        * Shuffle them before reading them
        * End result is different pretty much different every time
            * 149! combinations
        * Different order = different interpretations and such
    * *Hopscotch (Rayuela)*, J. Cortázar (1963)
        * 155 chapters
            * Chapters 57-155 deemed 'expendable'
        * Two narratives
                    * Horacio Oliveira, looking for someone called La Maga, in Paris
                    * Horacio Oliveira and his friend, Manolo Traveller, in Argentina
        * Two ways to read it
            * Chapters 1-56 in order
            * All chapters, following an order specified by instructions given in the book
                * Bonus chapters provide extra context to original chapters 1-56
    * *Un conte à votre façon*, R. Queneau (1967)
        * Title means 'A story your way', published as 'Yours for the telling'
        * Presented as numbered double-page spreads
        * Story on some pages, explicit choices on the next pages.
    * *The Unfortunates*, B. S. Johnson (1969)
        * 27 chapters, bound as pamphlets (within a box)
            * Designated first and last chapter
            * Other 25 chapters are to be read in any order
        * Basically the narrator's recollections on death and friendship

* Story, Narrative, Text
    * Three levels in fiction identified by narrative theory
        * Story
            * Content of a tale
            * Underlying events related  in a tale
        * Narrative (plot)
            * The recounting of a story
            * Re-ordering them by time/point-of-view
        * Text
            * The content processed by the reader
    * Non-linearity may be presented at all levels
        * In film
            * Citizen Kane - flashback/recounting
            * Short Cuts - mutlithreaded narrative
            * Pulp Fiction - mutlitheaded, flashbacks
            * Timecode - multiple simultaneous viewpoints
            * However, films don't expect audience to choose, so it's non-ergodic.
    * Difference between story and narrative:
        * Story is the overall thing, narrative is the order of it.
    * Difference between narrative and text
        * Narrative can remain constant, even if the method of delivery is different.
            * Remake of the same thing changes the text, but not necessarily the narrative.
