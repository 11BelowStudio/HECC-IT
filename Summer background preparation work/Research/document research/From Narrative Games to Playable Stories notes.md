# Notes

* Narrative Games and Playable Stories
    * Narrative Game
        * 'narrative meaning is subordinated to the player's actions'
            * 'story is meant to enhance gameplay'
            * Games that have 'concrete fictional worlds populated by recognizable objects and individual characters'
        * 'ludus activity'
            * ludus: conditional of 'ludi' (meaning 'to play'): https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ludus
            * 'player plays to win, to beat the game, and story is mostly a lure into the game world'
    * Playable Story
        * 'player's actions are subordinated to narrative meaning'
            * 'gameplay is meant to enhance story'
            * Games where 'the player is not narrowly focused on goals'
        * 'spirit of paidia infuses playable stories'
            * paidia: 'chldish play, fun, sport, game' https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%80%CE%B1%CE%B9%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%AC
            * 'no winning or losing: the purpose of the player is not to beat the game, but to observe the evolution of the storyworld'

* Methods of narrative design
    * Bottom-up
        * 'emergent systems that create stories during the run of the program'
            * 'world full of things and characters'
                * 'each of these objects is linked to a set of possible behaviours... when a behaviour is selected, it brings another state of the fictional world, and another set of behaviours comes available'
            * 'throw a number of characters with well-defined personality features together in a space, and you wait to see what kind of story will come out of their interactions'
        * 'favoured by playable stories'
        * drawbacks
            * 'lack of closure of their output'
                * 'virtually impossible to create an Aristotelian curve of rise and fall in tension, or a sequence of events that stops after a conflict has been resolved'
    * Top-down
        * 'rely on pre-scripted content'
            * 'no event generation on the fly'
            * 'progression is a journey along a path that is already traced and leads to a fixed destination, or to several destinations when the system offers branching points'
        * 'two ways to create top-down interactivity'
            * 'starting from the design of gameplay - and to wrap this gameplay into a story'
            * 'starting from a specific storyworld and inserting possibilities of user action to make it interactive'
                * 'storyworld takes precedence over story'
        * 'typical of narrative games'

* Types of narrative immersions
    * Note: these are dfferent to 'lucid immersion', as that 'presupposes a physically active participant'
    * Spatial Immersion
        * 'experiencing space through movement'
        * 'emotional attachment to a certain location... "sense of place"'
            * ~~oh hey its that term from A-level geography~~
        * 'not strictly narrative', but 'echoes the importance of the setting for readers of novels'
            * 'setting is the most easily remembered narrative component'
    * Epistemic Immersion
        * 'the desire to know'
        * Suits itself towards mystery stories
            * 'player impersonates the detective and investigates the case through the standard repetory of computer game actions'
            * 'player enacts the narrative of the investigation'
        * 'concerns events that already happened'
    * Temporal Immersion
        * 'includes three narrative effects: curiosity, surprise, and suspense'
            * curiousity and surprise
                * 'relatively unproblematic'
                * 'When participation takes the form of spatial exploration and leads to unexpected discoveries'
                    * 'its motivation is curiosity, and its reward is surprise'
            * suspense
                * 'more resistant to interactivity, because it requires long range-planning by system and top-down management of the player's expectations'
                * 'perople experience suspense when they can foresee two or more possible developments and are dying to find out which one of these paths the story will actualize'
                * problems
                    * 'when players can determine the path through their choice of acton, the uncertainty is lost'
                    * 'if a system generates an accidental event to prevent the player from fully controlling the outcome of the events, the effect will surprise rather than suspense'
    * Emotional Immersion
        * 'most problematic of all because it involves interpersonal relations between the player and computer-operated characters'
        * How this is done in types of games
            * 'narrative games deliberately sacrifice characters to action'
            * playable stories
                * 'create characters sufficiently lifelike to generate emptional reactions only by limiting the player's participation and hindering self-centered feelings'
                * Player may have feelings about the other characters in a game, a player 'does not entertain strong feelings for her avatar'

* Conclusion
    * 'With the networked structure of hypertext... interactivity has made a contribution to the postmodern destruction of narrative, much more than to the construction of a postmodern narrative'
        * 'involvement of the player remains peripheral'
        * 'confined to an observer role'
    * 'What remains to be conquered is the dramatic narrative, the type of plot that knots together several destinies into a dynamic network of human relations and then disentangles them to let characters go their own way'
        * 'The greatest hurdle to overcome... is the creation of personal and evolving relations between the user's character and the synthetic agents'

* **tl;dr**
    * Still have a long way to go to create truly interactive fiction
        * but immersion is still possible
    * what this means for my project
        * immersing player in game
            * May be able to achieve spatial immersion via worldbuilding
                * key is to develop a 'sense of place', even if the place is merely textual
            * Epistemic immersion
                * Make the player want to find out stuff, and give them the means of finding it out
            * Temporal immersion
                * Curiosity/surprise
                    * Let the player explore, rewarding them with unexpected discoveries
                * Suspense
                    * Let player foresee some possible developments as the story goes on
                    * Don't let them work out what the results of the path they're on will be until they reach the end of that path
                        * but don't generate the outcome of the events at random, as that leads to surprise instead of suspense
            * Emotional immersion
                * Make the characters lifelike-ish
                * Allow the player to form some sort of emotional bond with/towards the other characters
