# The notes

* Definitions
    * Cybertext
        * Name comes from 'Cybernetics'
        * 'the concept of cybertext does not limit itself to the study of computer driven... textuality'
        * 'focuses on mechanical organization of the text, by positing the intracies of the medium as an intergral part of the literary exchange. However, it also centers attention on the consumer, or user, of the text, as a more integrated figure'
            * 'the user of cybertext also performs in an extranoematic sense'
        * Cybertexts can be considered as 'a machine for the production of variety of expression'
        * When read, 'you are constantly reminded of inaccessible strategies and paths not taken, voices not heard'
            * Having choices, and not knowing exactly what you missed out, makes these 'very different from the ambiguities of a linear text' ('And inaccessibility... does not imply ambiguity but rather, an absence of possibility')
        * It's 'a broad textual media category. It is not in itself a literary genre of any kind'
    * Ergodic
        * Name comes from 'the Greek words *ergon* and *hodos*, meaning "work" and "path"'
        * 'In ergodic literature, nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text'
        
* Difference between reader of normal linear literature and a player of cybertext
    * Normal linear literature
        * May control the pace of the book
            * 'can study and interpret the shifting landscape'
            * 'may rest his eyes whenever he pleases'
            * can 'release the emergency brake and step off'
        * Powerless over the narrative
            * 'A reader, however strongly engaged in the unfolding of a narrative, is powerless'
            * 'cannot have the player's pleasure of influence'
        * 'The reader's pleasure is the pleasure of the voyeur'
            * 'Safe, but impotent'
        * It's a narrative.
    * Cybertext
        * 'is not safe, and therefore... she is not a reader'
        * Cybertext structure 'puts its would-be reader at risk: the risk of rejection'
        * 'effort and energy demanded by the cybertext of its reader raise the stakes of interpretation to those of intervention'
        * Cybertexts involve 'a struggle not merely for interpretive insight, but also for narrative control'
            * '"I want this text to tell *my* story; the story that *could not be* without me"'
                * Usually, 'the sense of individual outcome is illusory, but nevertheless the aspect of coercion and manipulation is real'
        * 'The cybertext reader *is* a player, a gambler'
            * 'the cybertext *is* a game-world or a world-game'
                * 'it *is* possible to explore, get lost, and discover secret paths in these texts, not metaphorically, but through the topological structures of the textual machinery'
        * It's a game
            * But 'they retain to a lesser or greater extent some aspects of narrative'
                * 'Most display some forms narrative behaviour, just as can be found in other non-narrative literary genres'
        
* Could think of a cybertext as being like a labyrinth
    * But not really, due to a general lack of consensus regarding what a labyrinth is

* Pre-existing examples of Ergodic Literature
    * The 'I Ching'
        * 'made up of sixty-four symbols, or hexagrams'
            * 'a hexagram contains a main text and six small ones, one for each line'
            * 'by manipulating three coins or forty-nine yarrow stalks according to a randomizing principle, the texts of two hexagrams are combined, producing one out of 4096 possible texts'
        * Ergodic because you need to perform some randomization, then use that to work out what part you need to read, and then read that.
    * The concept of hypertext
        * 'a strategy for organizing textual fragments in an intuitive and informal way, with 'links' between related sections of a text or between related parts of different texts in the same retrieval system'
        * Ergodic because you need to navigate it via links
    * MUDs
        * 'streams of continuing text and their collective, often anonymous readership and writership'
            * 'life in the MUD is literary, relying on purely textual strategies, and therefore provides a unique laboratory for the study of textual self-expression and self-creation, themes that are far from marginal in the practice of literary theory'
        * Ergodic because it involves interacting with the world and other players in the world
        

* What Cybertext is
    * 'Cybertext... is the wide range (or perspective) of possible textualities as seen as a typology of machines, as various kinds of literary communication systems where the functional differences among the mechanical parts play a defining role in determining the aesthetic process.'
    * 'must contain some kind of textual feedback loop'
    * 'shifts the focus from the traditional threesome of author/sender, text/message, and reader/receiver to the cybernetic intercourse between the various part(icipants) in the textual machine'
    
* What this means for my project
    * I guess my hypertext game should aim to take advantage of the scope for active user interaction
        * Don't need to rely on the technology to create a cybertext
    * Hypertext is a form of cybertext/ergodic literature
    * I can make the sort of thing that simply wouldn't be possible in the traditional form of purely linear text
        * Maybe some sort of reflective work on the stuff in society nowadays?
            * Probably satirical in nature?
                * Potential approaches for a satirical work
                    * Satirizing the people at the top of the food chain
                        * Player gets to make the decisions, finds out impact of them
                            * Player 'rewarded' for making the bad decisions, 'discouraged' from making the good decisions
                    * Looking at how people at the bottom of food chain are affected
                        * Perhaps giving player the illusion of being able to choose things, ultimately at the mercy of things beyond player's control?
                            * Maybe demonstrating the ultimate futility of the situation?
                            * Medium giving the capability to allow players to actively make a choice, yet denying that choice: will frustrate players, but will get them to question why their choices don't matter
        * Simulating a reader interacting with another person/in a particular role?
        * Something that puts emphasis on the reader actively participating, decision-making, and dealing with the consequences.
