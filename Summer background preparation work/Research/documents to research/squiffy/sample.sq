Squiffy is a tool for creating interactive stories.

You write your story in a text file. Each choice is represented by a [[new section]]. You can create links to new sections by surrounding them in double square brackets.

[[new section]]:

In addition to sections, Squiffy has the concept of passages. These are sections of text that don't advance the story. For example, you can click this [passage link], and this [other passage link], but the story won't advance until you click this [[section link]].

[passage link]:

This is the text for the first passage link.

[other passage link]:

This is the text for the second passage link.

[[section link]]:

When a new section appears, any unclicked passage links from the previous section are disabled.

Are you a [[gamer]](next, gender=gamer), a [[normie]](next, gender = normie), or are yuo a [[political]](next, gender=political)?

[[next]]:

ok {gender}.

you are {if gender=gamer:gamer}{else:{if gender=normie:normie}{else:political}}.

Clicking this [link] will show an alert.

[link]:
    var deezNuts = squiffy.get("gender");
    alert ("Hello, " + deezNuts + "!");
