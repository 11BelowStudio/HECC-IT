            <p>if you're reading this, that means that there's been a big oopsie with the passage loading lol.<br/>Or it means you're on internet explorer.<br/>Or you've disabled JavaScript.<br/>But yeah something's very clearly gone very wrong.</p>

        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>bottom text.</p>

<p>yes I know it looks terrible. but prototyping just do be like that, y'know? they don't think it be like that, but it do!</p>

<p>tbh this text underneath the game will probably be gone in the proper HECCER MVP thing. And the overall layout will hopefully be less Badâ„¢. No promises about the writing quality though.</p>

<p>but yeah enjoy the hypertext vidyagaem!</p>
