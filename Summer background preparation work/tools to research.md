    * https://twinery.org/
        * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twine_(software)
        * open source (which is nice): https://github.com/klembot/twinejs
* Tool 2 - TADS (Text Adventure Development System) (by Michael J. Roberts)  
    * https://www.tads.org/
        * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TADS
        * Freeware, should be able to try it out a bit to see how it works
* Tool 3 - Storyspace (Eastgate Systems)
    * http://www.eastgate.com/storyspace/
        * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyspace
        * Not freeware (costs $149), so I won't be able to try it out myself
            * Also only runs on mac, and I don't have a mac, so I definitely won't be able to try it out myself
            * Might be able to look at screenshots/other records of user experience to see how it works
* Tool 4 - Ren'Py (by Tom Rothamel)
    * https://www.renpy.org/
        * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%27Py
        * open-source: https://github.com/renpy/renpy
    * strictly speaking, it's a visual novel tool, not a hypertext game tool,
    but tbh it still has the end result of providing non-linear interactive fiction
* Tool 5 - eHyperTool  (by Dr. R. Bartle and C. Beck)
    * A copy of the specification is [in the 'Research/documents to research' folder](/Summer background preparation work/Research/documents to research/eHyperTool Design Document v1.02.docx)
        * (not a finished product, but the specification could come in handy for inspiration)
    * Hand-coded demo of the output it would produce is here: https://www.youhaventlived.com/cbdemo/
