::Greetings

Hello there.

[[Hello!|hi]]
[[Who are you?|stupid question]]

::stupid question

You know that's a stupid question, right?
You already know who I am!

[[Oh, ok.|hi]]
[[Nope, no idea.|new phone who this]]

::hi

I, the voice inside your head who talks to you to you when you're reading,
have a very important thing to talk to you about.

[[Which is...?|whats the buzz]]

::new phone who this

I'm the voice inside your head who talks to you when you're reading, obviously.
Who else could I have been?
It's not like anyone else is currently talking to you.

[[That makes sense.|makes sense]]
[[That's stupid!|getting very silly]]

::getting very silly

Well, excuuuse me.
The only reason for my existence is to speak to you when you're reading stuff.
If you're going to complain about me saying stupid things, why do you bother reading stupid things?

[[You make a compelling argument.|makes sense]]
[[Yep, this is still stupid.|stupidend]]

::stupidend

Right, that's it.
If you're going to complain about me saying what you're reading, I'll just stop you from reading anything else.

You're welcome.

::makes sense

Now, where we were?
Ah yes, now I remember.
I have a very important announcement to make.

[[What's the announcement?|whats the buzz]]

::whats the buzz

*ahem*

According to all known laws of aviation,
there is no way that a bee should be able to fly.
Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway.
Because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.

[[And this is important because...?|whats the point]]
[[Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow black. Yellow, black.|beemoviescript1]]

::beemoviescript1

Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

[[Barry! Breakfast is ready!|beemoviescript2]]

::beemoviescript2

Actually, wait, I've just had a call from my lawyer.
It looks like Dreamworks is going to sue us if we continue this performance of The Bee Movie.

[[Then why did you start performing it in the first place?|whats the point]]

::whats the point

Hello?
Voice inside your head that talks to you when you read things?
You read things, I say them to you?
That's what you read, so that's what I said.

[[None of this makes any sense.|no sense]]

::no sense

I agree.

You know what, let's just stop wasting our time reading this incomprehensible nonsense, and find something else to do.
You got any ideas?

[[Let's read something else.|good idea]]
[[Let's write something even better than this, and put the idiot who wrote this to shame.|shameless plug]]

::good idea

Welp, let's stop wasting our time here, and let's go do that instead!

::shameless plug

Well, I have a perfect idea for what we can use to write our even better thing.

Have you ever heard of a system called HECC-IT?
Actually, that's a silly question, seeing as you downloaded this game with that system.
So you probably know about it already.

We'll have to write our game in .hecc format,
and then we simply use the HECC-UP program to convert it into a playable HECCIN Game.

We can read the HECC-SPECC document to find out all the syntax and such for the .hecc format,
or we could just look at the .hecc file for this game and work it out from there.

So, let's write our own HECCIN Game, and put this poor excuse of a story to shame!

[[I agree, let's do this!|good idea]]
[[This sounds like a very poorly disguised advert.|shill alert]]

::shill alert

Hey, I'm just the voice that vocalizes the things you read.
Let's just blame the idiot who wrote this in the first place instead.

Anywho, it looks like they're running out of words for me to say to you.
So I guess this is the end.
