                If you're reading this, that means there's been a big oopsie with the passage loading lol.<br>
                It might be because you're on internet explorer.<br>
                Or you've disabled JavaScript.<br>
                Or perhaps your browser doesn't support JavaScript 6/JavaScript 2015<br>
                Alternatively, it might mean that someone forgot to unzip the folder this game came in,
                or that someone's misplaced the scripts that are needed for the game to run.<br>
                But yeah something's very clearly gone very wrong.</p>
