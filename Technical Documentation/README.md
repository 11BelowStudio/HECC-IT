# 3.2.0: Welcome to the Technical Documentation

If you're reading this, that either means you're here to assess this for the CE301 coursework,
or you've got a serious case of morbid curiosity. Either way, here is a table of contents for
you, for the technical documentation/discussion of my rapidly evaporating will to live.


# (3.2).1: [Designing HECC-IT](./Designing%20HECC-IT.md)

This discusses the design of HECC-IT, explains the thought processes behind aforementioned designs,
and discusses the development of the alpha version of HECC-IT produced prior to the
start of challenge week.

This also contains a [brief recap of some of the findings of the literature review](./recap%20of%20the%20literature%20review.md),
as section (3.2).1.1.1, in a separate document.

# (3.2).2: [Development of the Challenge Week MVP](./Development%20of%20the%20Challenge%20Week%20MVP.md)

This discusses the development of the first iteration of HECC-IT produced during Challenge Week
(the first version of the HECCIN' Game, the first version of HECC-UP, and the HECCIN' Game called
'A Conversation')

# (3.2).3: [Development of the Term 1 MVP](./Development%20of%20the%20Term%201%20MVP.md)

This discusses the development of the second iteration of HECC-IT, produced during the remainder of
the first term (the first iteration of OH-HECC, and several improvements to HECC-UP and the
HECCIN' Game).

This also covers [how OH-HECC holds the game data](./OH-HECC%20MVP%20editable%20passages,%20editable%20metadata,%20and%20GameDataObject.md)
as section (3.2).3.2.1, in a separate document (which that main document does provide a link to).

The [development of the remainder of OH-HECC](./MVP%20Development%20of%20OH-HECC.md) is also discussed
in its own document, as section (3.2).3.2.2, which is once again linked in the main document for this stage of
development.

# (3.2).4: [Development of the final version of HECC-IT](./Final%20version%20development.md)

This discusses the version of HECC-IT produced during term 2, along with the HECCIN' Game produced with
HECC-IT.

The [improvements to the HECCIN' Game](./final%20version%20HECCIN'%20Game.md) (section (3.2).4.1) were discussed
first, with this document going over the design/implementation of conditional statements (or
'guard conditions') within the HECCIN' Game, unit tests, and several other improvements made to it.

The [changes to the HECC-IT tool itself](./final%20version%20of%20HECC-IT.md) (section (3.2).4.2) are discussed
next, going over the many documented (and undocumented) improvements made to HECC-IT, and also
discusses the unit testing present in HECC-IT.

[The development of *Backblast*](./Backblast.md) (section (3.2).4.3) is discussed at the end. *Backblast*
was the game I produced as the final demonstration of this tool, and this document discusses
the design process of the game, the intent behind it, and the many shortcomings it had.


# (3.2).5: Appendices for the technical documentation

* Instructions for how to use HECC-IT and the .hecc language can be read in the [HECC-SPECC](../Documentation%20for%20HECC-IT/HECC-SPECC.md).

* Package-level readmes giving a brief overview of each class in the java source code are present within the [../src](../src)
  folder.
  
* Full Javadoc-style documentation for HECC-IT's codebase is availiable in the [../JavaDocs.zip](../JavaDocs.zip) folder.

* HECC-IT itself can be downloaded within the [../HECC-IT downloadable version.zip](../HECC-IT%20downloadable%20version.zip)
  folder.
  
    * Alternatively, the 'release' on this repository with this final version can be seen [here](https://github.com/11BelowStudio/HECC-IT/releases/3.0-Final_Deliverable).

With this all said and done, I suppose I should get back to the main word document.
