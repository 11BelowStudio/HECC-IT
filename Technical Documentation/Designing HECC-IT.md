# Designing HECC-IT

## The background reading

Before I designed HECC-IT, I looked at a range of existing hypertext game authoring tools, attempting to answer
the following key questions for each of them:

* How does it work?
* How is it used?
* What options does it give the user?
* What features does it have?
* What features doesn't it have?
* How do the outputs work?

The full list of tools I looked at were:

* [ChoiceScript](https://www.choiceofgames.com/make-your-own-games/choicescript-intro/)
* eHyperTool (*or, at very least, the specification of it, a copy of which was provided by Dr Bartle*)
* [Inform](http://inform7.com/)
* [Inklewriter](https://www.inklewriter.com/) and [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/)
