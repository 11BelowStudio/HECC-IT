# Term 2 - Developing the final version of HECC-IT

During term 2, I made several improvements to the HECCIN' Game (such as adding support for markdown
formatting, conditional statements, and general code cleanup), made some improvements to HECC-IT itself
(mostly back-end, involving the background logic, yet with a few substantial enhancements for user
experience), and created a proper hypertext game using HECC-IT.

## Part 1: The improvements to the HECCIN' Game

One of the first things I did during term 2 was start making improvements to the HECCIN' Game itself,
such as adding support for markdown formatting and conditional statements. The discussion of these
features, how they were implemented, and how they were utilized in another tech demo game, 
can be read [in this markdown document](./final%20version%20HECCIN'%20Game.md).

The HECC-SPECC for the final iteration of the .hecc language has also been produced,
and can be read in [Documentation for HECC-IT/HECC-SPECC.md](../Documentation%20for%20HECC-IT/HECC-SPECC.md).

Once that was done, I started to work on some improvements to HECC-IT and writing a 'proper' HECCIN'
Game, with both of these tasks being mostly performed concurrently. However, in this report, I shall
start by discussing the further work on HECC-IT.
