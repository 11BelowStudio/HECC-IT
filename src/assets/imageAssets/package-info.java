/**
 * very nice images used as icons and such for the JFrames and such in HECC-IT.<br>
 * As much as Duke is not a complete eyesore to look at, I was honestly bored of having that generic default icon
 * plastered all over my JFrames, so, I have some even worse icons for HECC-IT (and OH-HECC and HECC-UP) in here
 * that are used instead.
